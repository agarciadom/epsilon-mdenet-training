# Slides for MDENet Epsilon Playground training

These are the slides for the first training event in the [MDE-Net EPSRC expert network](https://www.mde-network.org/).

In order to compile the slides, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

You can then use `./compile.sh` to automatically compile them every time the `slides.md` file changes, or use `./compile.sh once` to compile the slides and immediately exit.
